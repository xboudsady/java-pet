# Interfaces

* Interfaces are a way to enforce certain fields or methods on a class

* Interfaces do not enforce exactly how these methods should be implemented - just that you must have them

* Interfaces are the definition of behavior

* When used, they force classes and objects to have certain properties without forcing their implementation
